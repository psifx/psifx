<v prof_normalized.wav>So, Erin, in your email you said you wanted to talk about the exam.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.360
<v student_normalized.wav>Yeah, um, I've just never taken a class with so many different readings.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.860
<v student_normalized.wav>I've managed to keep up with all the assignments, but I'm not sure how to... how to...

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.800
<v prof_normalized.wav>How to review everything?

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.940
<v student_normalized.wav>Yeah, in other classes I've had, there's usually just one book to review, not three different books, plus all those other text excerpts and videos.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.300
<v student_normalized.wav>Yes.
